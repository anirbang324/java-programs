1. We need to declare the array at first
2. Then we have to create memory location for it
3. now we can use the array



array can be declared in several ways :

int a[];
float a[];
int[] arr;
float[] arr;

array creation:

a = new int[10];
arr= new float[10];

we can also combine declaration and creation altogether :

int a=new int[15];


array initialization :

we can initialize the array by array subscripts -
arr[0] = 12
arr[1] = 13
.
.
.
.
arr[10] = 21


or we can initialize them altogether :

int arr[] = [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]

we can also assign an array object to another :

int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int b[];
b=a;
